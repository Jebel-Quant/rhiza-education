# Appendix A4 — Contributors

Rhiza and its ecosystem are built by a small group of people. This page lists every human contributor across the five core repositories — `rhiza`, `rhiza-cli`, `rhiza-tools`, `rhiza-hooks`, and `marimushka` — with their GitHub profiles and contribution counts.

Contribution counts reflect commits to the default branch as of the time this page was written. Automated commits from Renovate, Copilot, and other bots are excluded.

## Thomas Schmelzer · [tschm](https://github.com/tschm)

**Quant, Rhodes scholar, mathematician, coder, cyclist, angel investor.**
Stanford · ex-Team Q @ ADIA · Palo Alto & Abu Dhabi

Thomas is the creator and principal maintainer of Rhiza. The idea was born during his time on Team Q at the **Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA)**, one of the world's largest sovereign wealth funds, where he had direct exposure to the repo zoo problem at institutional scale. The experience of watching dozens of Python repositories drift apart — each maintained by different teams, each a different vintage of CI configuration — made the need for a continuous synchronisation system undeniable.

He later spent time as a Visiting Scholar at Stanford with Professor Stephen Boyd's group (the CVXGRP), which is also why `cvxgrp/simulator` — one of Boyd's group's tools — became an early external adopter of Rhiza.
