# Rhiza Education

Welcome to the Rhiza training curriculum. These lessons teach you how to adopt, configure, and work with **Rhiza** — the living template system that keeps Python project boilerplate consistent and up to date across all your repos.

## Curriculum

## How to use this curriculum

Work through lessons 1–6 in order on your first pass. Each lesson builds on the previous one. The appendices are self-contained — read whichever applies to your setup.

Lesson 3 is hands-on: you will need a GitHub (or GitLab) account and the ability to create a repository.
